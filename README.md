# The World's Stupidest Inductor

## What?

It's a PCB that's effectively a wirewound inductor. A series of almost-vertical, but parallel, traces run between vias along the top and bottom edges.

## Why?

I was making a tiny version of this in the 10's of nH range, and then... well why not make one that's as big as the cheap PCB fab dimensions will allow? I have no idea if it will even work, and even if it does happen to work I have no idea of the inductance value.

## Can I make one?

Do whatever you want with these design files, I'm not your dad (unless you're one of my amazing daughters, in which case do whatever you want with it.) 

I have released this design under CC0 terms into the public domain.
